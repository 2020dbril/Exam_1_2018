The function works as following:
It asks you to enter 6 grades, 3 SL numeric grades and 3 HL numeric grades.
After entering the 6 grades, it stores the grades into variables.
The variables are stored in two arrays, a HL array and a SL arrays
The variables in the arrays are compared to letter grades and added to a new arrays for both SL and HL
Then the SL numeric array is compared to a GPA scale which stores the total SL GPA scores
The same is done for the HL numeric array however the GPA scale is weighted
The total of both new arrays are added up and the average is found to output the GPA.
